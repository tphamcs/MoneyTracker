	 * The purpose of JDBC is to have your application be able to communicate with a relational database
	 * JDBC is an API included with Java (java.sql)
	 * 
	 * JDBC is able to communicate with a variety of different databases
	 * through the use of JDBC drivers
	 * 
	 * These drivers are managed using the JDBC Driver Manager
	 * 
	 * In order to obtain a connection, we need to have the driver loaded, and provide credentials such as our username, password, and
	 * connection string
	 * 
	 * Some important classes
	 * 1. java.sql.DriverManager
	 * 2. java.sql.Connection
	 * 3. java.sql.Statement
	 * 4. java.sql.ResultSet
	 * 
	 * A general workflow might be
	 * 1. Establish a connection
	 * 2. Create a Statement object
	 * 3. Execute a SQL query from that statement object
	 * 4. Process data from the ResultSet
	 * 
	 * WIthin this utility class, we will have a static method that retrieves a connection to the DB, or creates a connection
